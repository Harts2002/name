<h1> Welcome to GitHub Pages </h1>

<P1> I am Hao and this is my website. I will be posting my simple codes online in order to improve myself with the help of coders in Github. I'm still a beginner at computer science but I joined Github to improve so to anyone who visits my page, thank you for your time and comments. My codes can be found in the repositories which are linked under every work.</P1>
